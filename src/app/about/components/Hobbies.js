                If 2024 had a theme, it would be &quot;Try Everything&quot;—because that&quot;s exactly what I&quot;ve been doing.

                🧗 Bouldering | 🏃 Running | 💪 Calisthenics | 🎸 Bass & Guitar | 🎨 Drawing | 🍳 Cooking
                📸 Photography & Cinematography | ⛳ Golfing | 🏂 Snowboarding

                It&quot;s been a fun challenge exploring new hobbies, seeing what sticks, and pushing myself to step outside my comfort zone.
