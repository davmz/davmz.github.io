                If 2024 had a theme, it would be "Try Everything"—because that’s exactly what I’ve been doing.

                🧗 Bouldering | 🏃 Running | 💪 Calisthenics | 🎸 Bass & Guitar | 🎨 Drawing | 🍳 Cooking
                📸 Photography & Cinematography | ⛳ Golfing | 🏂 Snowboarding

                It’s been a fun challenge exploring new hobbies, seeing what sticks, and pushing myself to step outside my comfort zone.
