            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                I first got into computer science in high school, but I had no idea what I wanted to pursue long-term. Engineering? Software? Something else entirely?

                Being the quiet kid didn’t stop me from wanting to connect with others and be part of a community. That’s what eventually led me to Red River College Polytechnic to study Business Information Technology—a decision encouraged by my dad. Once I started, I saw the potential in myself and found success in my classes.

                My education was unique—remote learning for Grade 12 and two years of college during COVID—which made it harder to meet people at first. But by the end of college, I had the opportunity to connect with a lot of great people.

                What truly amazed me about tech was how a simple spark of an idea could turn into something real—from development to production. That realization fueled my passion for building.

            <h3>Church Involvement</h3>
            <p>
                Being involved in church helped me discover my true self. It made me realize what I truly needed—a Savior to guide and influence my life and future. My faith isn’t something I hide, but I also don’t force it on anyone. It’s simply a part of who I am.
                Looking ahead to 2025, I’m making a conscious shift—prioritizing character growth, mindset shifts, and letting go of bad habits that have held me back. It’s a year of transformation.
